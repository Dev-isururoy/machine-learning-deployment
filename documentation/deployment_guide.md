# Deployment Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the machine learning model using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with deployment, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Docker: [Installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Git: [Installation instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Steps for Deployment

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd model_deployment

2. Build the Docker Image
    
    Navigate to the project directory and build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile: cd model_deployment
                docker build -t model_deployment .

3. Run the Docker Container
    
    Run the Docker container with the following command:
    docker run -p 5000:5000 model_deployment

4. Access the Web Application
    
    Once the container is running, you can access the web application in your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.


Usage  
    
    To use the deployed machine learning model:
       
                 1. Open the web application in your browser.
                 2. Enter the required input features.
                 3. Click on the "Predict" button to obtain the model's prediction.

Customization

    Model Configuration: Modify the model configuration and parameters in the app.py file.
    Styling: Customize the CSS styles in the style.css file to match your preferences or branding.

Troubleshooting

    If you encounter any issues during deployment or usage, refer to the troubleshooting section in the README.md file or seek assistance from the project maintainers.
