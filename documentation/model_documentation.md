# Model Documentation

This document provides documentation for the machine learning model deployed in the project.

## Overview

The deployed model is a machine learning model that performs [task or prediction]. It is integrated into a Flask web application for easy deployment and interaction.

## Model Details

- **Model Type**: [Type of model, e.g., linear regression, random forest, neural network, etc.]
- **Framework/Libraries Used**: [Libraries or frameworks used for model training and deployment, e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.]
- **Performance Metrics**: [Metrics used to evaluate the model's performance, e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, etc.]

## Features

The model uses the following features for prediction:

1. Feature 1: [Description of feature 1]
2. Feature 2: [Description of feature 2]
   ...
   
## Usage

To use the deployed model:

1. Access the web application in your browser.
2. Enter the required input features.
3. Click on the "Predict" button to obtain the model's prediction.

## Example

Here is an example of how to interact with the deployed model:

- Input:
  - Feature 1: [Value]
  - Feature 2: [Value]
    ...

- Output/Prediction: [Predicted output]

## Limitations and Considerations

- [Limitations of the model, e.g., assumptions, constraints, etc.]
- [Considerations for using the model in practice, e.g., data preprocessing, model retraining, etc.]

## Further Improvements

- [Suggestions for further improvements or enhancements to the model or the deployment process.]

## References

- [List of references or resources used for model development or deployment.]
