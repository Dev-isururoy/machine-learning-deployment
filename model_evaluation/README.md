# Model Evaluation

This directory contains files related to the evaluation of machine learning models.

## Evaluation Notebook

The [evaluation_notebook.ipynb](evaluation_notebook.ipynb) file is a Jupyter Notebook that contains code and explanations for evaluating the performance of machine learning models.

## Evaluation Scripts

The [evaluation_scripts/](evaluation_scripts/) directory contains Python scripts for evaluating machine learning models.

- [evaluate_model.py](evaluation_scripts/evaluate_model.py): Python script for evaluating the performance of a trained machine learning model.

## Metrics

The [metrics/](metrics/) directory contains visualizations and metrics generated during model evaluation.

- [confusion_matrix.png](metrics/confusion_matrix.png): Confusion matrix visualization.
- [accuracy_plot.png](metrics/accuracy_plot.png): Plot showing the accuracy of the model over time.

## Requirements

The [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file lists all the Python dependencies required for model evaluation.
